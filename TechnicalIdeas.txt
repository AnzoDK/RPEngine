Hver karakter som et objekt. Med en std::vector som holder alle Sprite states. De skal kunne oversættes gennem en enum


Vinduet skal styres gennem et custom lib, som kan kalde vindue funktioner baseret på operativsystemet

New idea for end-users to add "scripts"

All to::Base must have a std::vector of type Script Base*

They must also have a function for returning the current scripts, and setting new ones

Indexing of this vector must be by either index int or a string containing
The name of the Script Base

ScriptBase is going to be a devrived class of to::Base
With an overriden empty draw void

If this becomes too nested, then we can just not make it devrived and make a new
Class for ScriptBase

A new class called CustomScriptLoader must be made to take a string to a folder with scripts

Scripts should be in .h format and will all be registered by the CustomScriptLoader and written to a
Header file that afterwards will be included in the program

This process needs to be able to "save" the scripts in a way that allows removing the scripts folder
After compiling
